# Neovim Config (WIP - Not complete)

This repo is my entire neovim config geared towards development in the following languages:
- Typescript
- Javascript
- HTML/CSS
- Java
- Golang

(The last two are primarily for work - side note I don't enjoy them as much as web development :()

Possible plugins (putting this here so I can document my thought process along the journey):
- nvim-lsp (builtin LSP of nvim)
- nvim-lsp-installer (adds support to automate most of the heavy lifting of installing language servers for nvim-lsp)
- nvim-cmp (to get some VSCode like autocompletion)
- nvim-neoclip (clipboard manager)
- just black (color scheme)
